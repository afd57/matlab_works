# Matlab Working 

## Statistics and Probability

It is my work on Matlab for statistics and probability lesson in my university year. We used Matlab in statistics and probability-[MAT301](./MAT301) lesson in 2014. "Intuitive Probability and Random Processes Using MatLab - Steven M. Kay" was used in this lesson [MAT301](./MAT301) as a main material. 

This working includes;

- Simulation of probability experiments.
- Probability calculation with Matlab.
- Fair, Unfair toss coin experiment.
- Probability density function
- Cumulative distribution function
- Normal distribution
- Binomial distribution
- Poisson distribution

**Note**: The report inside of hw folders contain a lot of simple explanation for understanding probabilty better but the reports are completely Turkish. It can be translated into English in here https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=docs&sl=tr&tl=e
