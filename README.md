# Matlab Working 

## Statistics and Probability

It is my work on Matlab for statistics and probability lesson in my university year. We used Matlab in statistics and probability-[MAT301](./MAT301) lesson in 2014. "Intuitive Probability and Random Processes Using MatLab - Steven M. Kay" was used in this lesson [MAT301](./MAT301) as a main material. 

This working includes;

- Simulation of probability experiments.
- Probability calculation with Matlab.
- Fair, Unfair toss coin experiment.
- Probability density function
- Cumulative distribution function
- Normal distribution
- Binomial distribution
- Poisson distribution

**Note**: The report inside of hw folders contain a lot of simple explanation for understanding probabilty better but the reports are completely Turkish. It can be translated into English in here https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=docs&sl=tr&tl=e



## Image Processing - 1

I worked on digital image processing on my licensing project in 2014.

This working includes;

- Fundamentals of Image Processing: MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox 
- Filters
- Transformations and Registration
- Image segmentation
- Color-Based Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
- Image processing in frequency domain

My presentation and report in this path [Doc](./ImageProcessing-1/Doc). The source code is in [Matlab Image Processing Source Code](./ImageProcessing-1/matlab_workspace)



**Note**: The [documents](./ImageProcessing-1/Doc) is very useful but they are completely Turkish. They can be translated into English in here https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=docs&sl=tr&tl=e



## Morphological Image Processing

I worked on morphological image processing on my licensing project in 2015. 

My report in this path [Doc](./ImageProcessing-2/Doc). The source code is in [Matlab Image Processing Source Code](./ImageProcessing-2/SourceCode)



**Note**: The [documents](./ImageProcessing-2/Doc) is very useful but they are completely Turkish. They can be translated into English in here https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=docs&sl=tr&tl=e

DAÄžLI Aziz. F. Morphological Image Processing Applications Licensing Project, Ankara, 2015.

We investigated how to solve daily problems with the morphological image processesing.Detection of objects with certain shapes and counting (clusters of stars, cells, fruits), noise reduction, detection of defects in an image are among the applications that are investigated.



This working includes;

- Defect Detection Application with Morphological Image Processing
- Automatic Fruit Recognition and Counting Application
- Traffic Signs Detection Application



#### Defect Detection Application with Morphological Image Processing

One of the most basic application is defect detection application. This application and similar applications are used by company in industry. This applications are not only save workload but also rise up product quality.

#### Automatic Fruit Recognition and Counting Application

The apllication counter fruit on the tree. The application are used by fruit juice company.

The application supply information how many tons of fruit , before the fruit harvest.And the application determine fruits location on the tree. The fruit that is determined by the application can be automatically harvest .

#### Traffic signs detection application

The application detect traffic signs on the road and supply information driver or cars system. But this application detect only shape traffic sign .
